;; This is the basic record format of an upgrade
;;
;; The version-name must be a unique keyword from all other upgrades
;;
;; The upgrade and downgrade fields are either a SQL string or a
;; function to run when performing the upgrade/downgrade process.
;; When it is a function, it will recieve a single argument of a
;; java.sql.Connection to use for the upgrade.  The connection will
;; have auto-commit turned off, and the result will be committed after
;; normal return from the function.
;;
;; When possible, it is highly preferred to have the upgrade and
;; downgrade be SQL strings.  This is because the SQL will then be
;; recorded in the schema_version table.
